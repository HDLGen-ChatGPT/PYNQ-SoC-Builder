# Config File - Luke 03/09/24
# This file will contain many switches and configuration options which can be set to true or false as needed.
# This file is intended to be a fast way to make very advanced/specific changes which shouldn't typically be needed.
# Idea is to enable switches and configuration much faster as GUI design is a very lengthy process.

# All config parameters must be full block capital to make them recognisable
